aout.py is the main entry point. runs on python 3.6 or better (I hope).
a.out is the C binary, but you mostly likely have to rebuild it, was compiled on a mac. buildscript.sh provided for your convenience.
a.out will also run by itself.

makecsv4.py and makecsv5.py are there just for reference, they are the original files and not being used by the running programs.
